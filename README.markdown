FrontCMS
========

You code, your clients manage
-----------------------------

**Attention**: This content management system is in a very early stage of development. There is no documentation, no guaranteed compatibility with future releases, this is *not even an alpha version*. Use at your own risk!

The idea behind FrontCMS is to give you the freedom to layout a webpage anyway you like while still being able to give your client an easy way to edit the content.

There will be no backend, thus the name FrontCMS. The content will be manageable through the frontend in a true what-you-see-is-what-you-get manner. No steep learning curve for your clients!

You code the website, marking editable areas directly in the code, and FrontCMS will display the fitting editing interface for your client.

If you want to keep an eye on this project, feel free to *star* or *watch* it.

Happy coding!
